# pdjr-kicad-nmea2000-common

This project provides a PCB design for a generic NMEA 2000 module
consisting of a Teensy microcontroller, module power supply, CAN
interface, and user interface consisting of configuration and display
elements.

The idea is that this PCB design can be used as the basis of a
real NMEA 2000 module by importing the design into the target
project.

## HOW TO

1. Create a new Kicad project.
2. Open pcbnew
